# CRUD-Application
A functional Node.js + Express CRUD blog app focused on backend logic and routing. Prioritized application functionality over design.

Node.js & Express Blog App
A simple blog application demonstrating basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The purpose of this project is to showcase backend logic and RESTful routing for a blog, with a focus on functionality over design. The app uses body-parser to handle form data, UUID to generate unique IDs for each post, and EJS with header/footer partials for templating. Bootstrap is included for basic styling.
Features
Create new blog posts via a form.
Read and list all posts on the homepage.
Update existing posts through an edit form.
Delete posts directly from the interface.
Form handling with body-parser middleware.
Unique post IDs generated by UUID.
Templating with EJS, using reusable header and footer partials.
Responsive layout with Bootstrap.
RESTful routes and HTTP verbs for all CRUD actions, including method-override support for PUT/PATCH/DELETE in forms.
